## Please note that due to privacy constraints many files in this repo have significant portions of identifiable code marked as REDACTED
## Generally the code skeleton remains.

## The best example of a larger Python project is in the NRDT-DB folder.

For a Java sample please see: https://github.com/thatRichman/JGraphGenome/

JGraphGenome is a (very) early stage sandbox attempt at building a graph-based genome tool in Java. 
Mostly for fun, under no serious development.


For a Julia sample please see: https://github.com/thatRichman/BioServices.jl/blob/feature/bioDBnet/src/bioDBnet.jl
